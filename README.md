# Solutions of C/C++ exercises/projects#

I am a Research Engineer at Vilnius University (VU) working on programming, bioinformatics and ML project involving scRNA analysis by writing codes, analyses and scripting with Python and C++.

Here are the C/C++ solutions of the problems given by the Physics Department on the C/C++ programming course when I worked at VU as Doctoral Researcher. Here you will find a total of 24 solved problems throughout my work as RA & RE from 2015 to 2020.

Explanations are in English and Lithuanian.
