# Solutions of C/C++ exercises/projects#

I am a Research Engineer at Vilnius University working on programming, bioinformatics and ML projects writing codes and scripting with Python and C++.

Here are the C/C++ solutions of the problems given by the Physics Department on the C/C++ programming course when I worked at VU as Research Associate. Here you will find a total of 24 solved problems throughout my work as RA from 2016 to 2019.

Most explanations are in Lithuanian that will be transalted to English when I find time. 

<br> By '21 will replenish knowledge and finish through [this course on C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/video-course-c-from-beginner-to-expert/). </br>
