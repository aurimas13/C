# C-solutions

I am a PhD student at Vilnius University working on bioinformatics and computational chemistry project applying scripting and Python with C++.

Here are the C/C++ solutions of the problems given by the Physics Department on the C/C++ programming course. Here you will find a total of 24 solved problems through my doctoral studies in 2019. It took a month to write them.

Most explanations are in Lithuanian that will be transalted to English when I find time.
