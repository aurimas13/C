# Solutions of C/C++ exercises/projects

<!-- While being a Research Engineer at Vilnius University (VU) I worked on computing, bioinformatics and ML projects, of which the current one involves analysis of scRNA by writing codes, analyses and scripting with Python and C++.
 -->
 
Here are the C/C++ solutions of the problems given by the Physics Department on the C/C++ programming course when I worked at Vilnius University as a Doctoral Researcher. Here you will find a total of 24 solved problems throughout my work as Research Associate & Research Engineer from 2016 to 2020.

Explanations are in English and Lithuanian. 

By '22 will replenish knowledge and finish through [this course on C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/video-course-c-from-beginner-to-expert/).
