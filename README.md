# C-solutions

I am a Research Associate at Vilnius University working on programming, bioinformatics and computational chemistry projects applying scripting and Python with C++.

Here are the C/C++ solutions of the problems given by the Physics Department on the C/C++ programming course. Here you will find a total of 24 solved problems throughout my work as RA from 2016 to 2019.

Most explanations are in Lithuanian that will be transalted to English when I find time.
